I added a lot of new things, including a somewhat new design of the site. I would upload screenshots of the differences here, but I'm a bit too lazy...

I'm currently trying to figure out ways to make the website a little less visually overwhelming! It's a pretty difficult thing to do for me. 

Inset shadows are also a new addition to the site. Some implementations of it look better than others though...

**Line spacing**!! I adjusted it a little bit for the site, and now my posts are far more readable! 

Changed my navbar to have a fixed position! For easier use. But I might change it back to absolute if it makes reading posts a difficult experience.


# View Transitions!
I learned how to use the view transitions API for Astro! It works pretty well, but I can only make it work with links, not buttons for switching pages. 

I think I'll also add animate on scroll (AOS) sometime soon? But I should find a purpose for it first...

# What I've learned about web design (AKA my web design notes)

- Simple layouts are best! Try not to overcrowd the pages you create, and *use a lot of whitespace*!!

- Have multiple ways to access articles (i.e a direct list of links vs a more visual layout)

- Don't use overwhelming color schemes!
    - I definitely struggled with this the most during the early days. I just wanted to use all of my favorite colors, but it turns out that they don't work too well together.
    - In the end, I just decided to go with a simple dark mode theme with white(ish, lowers painful contrast) text and a couple accent colors. 
    - You can still use multiple colors in the website, but it's important to choose

- Above all, focus on readability...

- Borders aren't all that great in modern design... but "card" designs are (combination of inset and box shadows)
