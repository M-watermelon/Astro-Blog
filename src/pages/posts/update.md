I added a lot of new things, including a somewhat new design of the site. I would upload screenshots of the differences here, but I'm a bit too lazy...

I'm currently trying to figure out ways to make the website a little less visually overwhelming! It's a pretty difficult thing to do for me. 

Inset shadows are also a new addition to the site. Some implementations of it look better than others though...

**Line spacing**!! I adjusted it a little bit for the site, and now my posts are far more readable! 

Changed my navbar to have a fixed position! For easier use. But I might change it back to absolute if it makes reading posts a difficult experience.


# View Transitions!
I learned how to use the view transitions API for Astro! It works pretty well, but I can only make it work with links, not buttons for switching pages.
