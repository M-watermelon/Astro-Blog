## To do (maintenance):
- [ ] Reorder the post display
- [X] Add a markdown prop for post summaries
- [X] Fix the favicon (which works on localhost but not when published)

    - The fix: **do not use the public folder for the file path!!** It works like this: 
    
    ```html 
    href='/Astro-Blog//images/duckie_i.png' 
    ```

- [ ] Add an image carousel of my microscope slides (could be a way to make the site more interactive)
- [ ] Responsive web-design!! I need to make this site mobile friendly

## Hopeful goals:
- [ ] Figure out ways to make the site interactive
- [ ] Make a search bar?
- [ ] RSS feeds?

## Much more long term goals?
- [ ] Explore making UIs with react? 
- [ ] Make some kind of game or interactive resource?
