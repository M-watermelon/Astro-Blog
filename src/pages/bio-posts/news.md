## I am majoring in biochemistry!
I got some college acceptances back and it looks like I'll be going into a pharmaceutical career! I like to program and make websites, but I feel like I would struggle in the current computer science career atmosphere. I'd say the case is the same for cybersecurity. These things are fun in terms of computer literacy, but the work-life seems brutal. And although I haven't talked about it much here, I actually really love biology. It comes to me a lot more naturally than anything computer related. And I love physics too, especially the more "abstract" concepts like electricity and molecular interactions. I don't really enjoy  traditional mechanics :(.
