# So I joined a lab in chemistry

I spent a semester shadowing a combined physical and analytical chemistry research group, and somehow I got a lot of experience working on optical instrumentation. I ended up learning a lot more about physics concepts than chemistry, but that's actually an amazing thing in my point of view. This experience was especially awesome because the optics and physics background I got from this earned me the other research position I am starting next semester!


# Next semester I'm joining a lab in physics!

They're using nanomaterials and a technique called Optically detected magnetic resonance [(ODMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optically_detected_magnetic_resonance). It's sort of similar to how an MRI works, but we're going to use it to measure the electrical potential gradients inside cells.
