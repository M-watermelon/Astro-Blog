## Currently working on:

### Principles of Clinical Pharmacology (*11/22/24*)
I recently registered for this online course hosted by the NIH. I have access to it until August of 2025, and that's fine, because I'll be a lot busier after that date. I think I have lots to do for the next 8 months!

## Past projects
Here are some things that I either did in the past, or am planning on eventually reaching back to:

      - HarvardX Principles of Biochemistry

## Cool online resources
Here are some interesting biology related websites I've compiled! They go from simple references to increasingly advanced topics or professional sites.

*   [World of Biochemistry](https://worldofbiochemistry.blogspot.com/) - a bit old, but has good information on biomolecules and biochemical processes.
*   [Common organic chemistry](https://commonorganicchemistry.com/index.htm) - resources, common reactions, and internship listings
*   [Linux for biologists](https://linuxforbio.vimalkvn.com/)
*   [Biology libretexts](https://bio.libretexts.org/)
*   [Principles of Clinical Pharmacology](https://ocreco.od.nih.gov/courses/pcpRegistration.html) - an online course hosted by the NIH with free registration!
*   [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) - a collection of biomedical literature
*   [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) - Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
*   [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/t/tutorials/) - References and forums concerning bioinformatics
*   [Final Spark](https://finalspark.com/) - a cool project on biological computing

## Microscope slides
One day, I'll post a photo carousel of my microscope slides, especially since I'm using Astro!

## My favorite biology book:
 **The Color Atlas of Biochemistry:**
